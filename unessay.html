    <p>My digital historical unessay is about “<strong>Verifying the Authorship of William Shakespeare’s Plays by Stylometry</strong>”.<br><br>
        <strong>Stylometry</strong> means the application of the study of linguistic style. William Shakespeare wrote many works in his lifetime, and the amount is so vast that questions arise as to whether he could write them all alone.<br><br>
        One of the most common applications of stylometry is in authorship attribution. Given an anonymous text, it is sometimes possible to guess who wrote it by measuring certain features. In previous studies, they focused on authorship attribution of Shakespeare’s plays, analyzing the contributions of Shakespeare and other writers. However, in my unessay, I want to concentrate on observing how different his plays vary in writing style, and how did his style change in time.<br><br>
        Stylometry is the quantitative study of literary style through computational distant reading methods. It is based on the observation that authors tend to write in relatively consistent, recognizable and unique ways. Especially, the ways in which writers use small function words, such as articles, prepositions and conjunctions, has proven particularly telling. Function words have also been identified as important markers of literary genre and of chronology.<br><br>
        There are various approaches to studying stylometry. I want to focus on the algorithmic approach in my unessay, the method called the <strong>word adjacency network</strong>. We cannot explain in psychological, or artistic terms just why various words cluster with other words. We can, however, capture for different texts just how far from one another they tend to place each of a large set of preselected words (“target words”) in which we are interested. It turns out that the habits of placement, that is, the choices of words and how far from one another they are placed vary enough from text to text. This idea will be a reliable test for identifying similarity for my unessay.<br><br>
        A word adjacency network (WAN) is a mathematical system, a Markov chain, that represents the proximities of certain words within a text. Given a list of words-of-interest, a text to process, the algorithm will record in a Markov chain, as a matrix, the averaged distances at which each of the words-of-interest is found from each of the others. I assumed that the habit of placing certain function words near to other function words is an authorial characteristic that varies from one writer to another in a distinctive and relatively consistent way.<br><br>
        The comparison of a WAN derived from one text, and the WAN derived from another text, is a comparison of differing probability distributions. For this comparison the standard measure from information theory known as Kullback-Leibler divergence, more colloquially, relative entropy may be used. When comparing the relative entropy between WANs from multiple texts, the lowest values tend to be in similar structure. This fact is exploited in application of the WAN method to my unessay, we can examine which plays of William Shakespeare’s has similar structure, and classifying his work according to how style has changed as time goes on and by other features.<br><br>
        As the time goes on, I will analyze his work and visualize them with images, especially using heat maps of values of the relative entropies. A heat map is a 2-dimensional data visualization technique that represents the magnitude of individual values within a dataset as a color. I will create a GitHub web page with a description and code of the project. Also, I am going to visualize my data with heat maps and various python libraries. Through my unessay, I look forward to filling the gap between literary research and data science, providing a wider perspective on Shakespeare’s contribution to literature and history.<br>
        </p>

    <h2>Main Question</h2>
    <p>Compared to his status in English literature, not much is known about William Shakespeare's own life. Since Shakespeare's life information is very limited, the introduction of computer science allows a thorough and systematic analysis of research. With the lack of historical data on Shakespeare, it is very important to deduce indirectly the life or creative process through his work. In this process, computer science can provide new ideas through various tools.<br><br>
        Authorship of William Shakespeare is an active area of research. However, previous studies did not make sufficient research on Shakespeare's plays, such as just analyzing the contributions of Shakespeare and other writers. So, I wanted to focus on another research area, find out how similar Shakespeare's plays were in writing style.<br><br>
        Therefore, my main question of my work will be “<strong>How different William Shakespeare’s plays varies in his writing style, and how did his style change in time?</strong>”. I will proactively use and apply some computer science techniques in my work.<br>
        </p>

    <h2>Main Messages</h2>
    <p>My work aims to provide a new view of Shakespeare's study through an algorithmic approach. By analyzing Shakespeare's works, using the word adjacency network, the limitations of existing literature can be overcome, and new avenues of research can be opened.<br><br>
        First, the literature of Shakespeare's existing studies has some limitations and has been based mainly on traditional methods of literary analysis. It is difficult to make an objective analysis due to the personal opinions and interpretations of literary critics and is inefficient in terms of time and effort to analyze Shakespeare's vast text one by one.<br><br>
        Furthermore, it is difficult to identify hidden patterns because there are no tools to systematically compare similarities between works. To overcome these limitations, analyses using digital methods, especially the word adjacency network, have many positive effects. Through statistical algorithms and methods, consistent analysis is possible, and allows the rapid processing of large amounts of text data using computer science technologies. In addition, relationships in the text and theoretical measurements of information enable subjective similarities to hidden language patterns to be identified.<br><br>
        My unessay offers new opportunities to study Shakespeare. Analyzing the changes in the similarities of works as time goes on, we can understand the changes in Shakespeare's plays by times and through the unusual patterns found in certain works, might clarify whether he has collaborated with other authors. It also helps understand and visualize complex data more intuitively to create new hypotheses.<br><br>
        I made complex data more intuitive through visualization. The large amount of data generated can be easily identified through multiple processes and visualizations, which helps to establish and verify new hypotheses. For example, visualizing the similarities between Shakespeare's works can clearly show how Shakespeare’s works have changed over time.<br><br>
        I also visually expressed similarities between Shakespeare’s plays, changes in time and patterns and provide research results in the form of a website so that users can interact directly with the data and explore the results of the analysis.<br>

    <h2>Argument</h2>
    <p>
        Scholars who study Shakespeare usually classify Shakespeare's 37 plays into four periods depending on the time of creation.<br><br>
        <strong>The First Period</strong><br><br>
        The first period was a period of study (1590-1594), during which he mainly wrote historical dramas and comedies. This period was a process of imitation of old writers and search for one's own. There are eight works in this period: Henry IV, parts 1-3, Ricahrd III, The Comedy of Errors, Titus Andronicus, Taming of the Screw, and Two Gentlemen of Verona.<br><br>
        <strong>The Second Period</strong><br><br>
        The second period was the growth period (1595-1600), further expanding the previous comedy world. There are thirteen works in this period: Love's Labours Lost, Romeo and Juliet, A Midsummer Night's Dream, King John, The Merchant of Venice, Henry IV, part 1~3, Much Ado About Nothing, Henry V, Julius Caesar, As You Like It, and Twelfth Night.<br><br>
        <strong>The Third Period</strong><br><br>
        The third period was during the period of King Sook-gi (1601-1607). This period was an era when great tragedies were created intensively. There are nine works in this period: Hamlet, The Merry Wives of Windsor, Troilus and Cressida, All's Well That Ends Well, Mearure for Measure, Othello, King Lear, Macbeth, and Antony and Cleopatra.<br><br>
        <strong>The Fourth Period</strong><br><br>
        In the fourth period (1608-1613), Shakespeare tested a new genre of non-comedy. There are seven works in this period: Coriolanus, Timon of Athens, Pericles, Prince of Tyre, Cymbline, Winter's Tale, The Tempest, and Henry III.<br><br>
        Based on this fact, let's analyze the similarity of Shakespeare's plays over time.<br><br>
        The change in relative entropy over time could not be analyzed significantly. It is easy to see how different a specific play is from the play for each play.<br><br>
        In the graph analyzing the relative entropy of Henry VI, part 1 with other plays, it was confirmed that the relative entropy values of Henry VI, part 2 and part 3 used at almost the same time and numbered differently were significantly lower.<br><br>
        In addition, when analyzing several graphs, it was confirmed that relative entry values of historical dramas such as Henry IV, V, VI, and King John were all generally low and had structural similarities. Surprisingly, it was confirmed that relative entry values for each genre form a cluster in comedy and tragedy genres, not limited to historical dramas.

    <h2>Discussion</h2>
    <p>
        I have asked my historical question to <strong>ChatGPT</strong>. The answer from the machine is as follows.<br><hr>
        How different did William Shakespeare’s plays vary in his writing style, and how did his style change over time?<br><br>
        William Shakespeare's writing style evolved significantly over the course of his career, reflecting changes in both his personal artistic development and the broader trends in Elizabethan and Jacobean drama. Here’s a look at how his style varied across different periods and plays:<br><br>
        <strong>Early Works (1590s)</strong><br><br>
        Shakespeare's early plays, such as "Henry VI" (Parts 1, 2, and 3) and "The Comedy of Errors," show him experimenting with the established forms of his time. These plays are characterized by:<br><br>
        <li>
            <strong>Structured Verse</strong>: Regular iambic pentameter, with a clear, rhythmic quality.<br>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Rhetorical Flourish</strong>: Use of elaborate metaphors and classical allusions, reflective of his education and the tastes of the Elizabethan audience.<br>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Comedic Elements</strong>: Farcical humor and wordplay, especially in his comedies like "The Taming of the Shrew."<br><br>
        </li>
        <strong>Middle Period (Late 1590s to Early 1600s)</strong><br><br>
        This period includes some of Shakespeare's most famous works, such as "Romeo and Juliet," "A Midsummer Night's Dream," and "Hamlet." His style during this time shows significant development:<br><br>
        <li>
            <strong>Complex Characters</strong>: A move towards more nuanced and psychologically complex characters, as seen in "Hamlet" and "Romeo and Juliet."<br>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Poetic Language</strong>: Rich, lyrical language and extended metaphors, particularly in the romantic and tragic genres.<br>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Innovative Plots</strong>: Experimentation with structure and dramatic tension, including the use of subplots and intricate storylines.<br><br>
        </li>
        <strong>Mature Works (Early 1600s)</strong><br><br>
        Shakespeare's mature period includes tragedies like "Othello," "King Lear," and "Macbeth," as well as dark comedies and problem plays such as "Measure for Measure" and "Troilus and Cressida." Characteristics of this period include:<br><br>
        <li>
            <strong>Darker Themes</strong>: Exploration of betrayal, ambition, and existential despair, reflecting a more cynical and introspective view of human nature.<br>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Dense Language</strong>: A more compact and forceful use of language, with less rhetorical flourish and more focus on raw emotion and psychological depth.<br>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Structural Innovation</strong>: Greater complexity in narrative structure, often breaking traditional forms to enhance dramatic impact.<br><br>
        </li>
        <strong>Late Works (1610s)</strong><br><br>
        In his final years, Shakespeare wrote romances such as "The Tempest," "The Winter's Tale," and "Cymbeline." These plays combine elements of comedy, tragedy, and fantasy, showcasing a synthesis of his earlier styles:<br><br>
        <li>
            <strong>Pastoral and Fantastical Elements</strong>: Use of magical and pastoral settings, reflective of a more escapist and redemptive tone.<br>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Redemption and Reconciliation</strong>: Themes of forgiveness, reconciliation, and the healing power of time.<br>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Mature Verse</strong>: A return to a more lyrical and harmonious style, blending the complexity of his middle period with the simplicity of his early works.<br><br>
        </li>
        <strong>Evolution of Style</strong><br><br>
        Overall, Shakespeare's style evolved from the formal and structured verse of his early plays to a more flexible and expressive use of language in his mature works. This evolution reflects his growing mastery of dramatic and poetic techniques, as well as his deepening understanding of human nature. His later plays often show a blending of genres and a more philosophical approach to storytelling, marked by a profound exploration of themes such as identity, power, and the nature of reality.<br><hr>
        I have compared the core of the machine-generated answer with my own creative, compelling argument.<br><br>
        Shakespeare's work, from a quantitative and qualitative point of view, provides a complementary view of his style of change. I analyzed the changes in style between Shakespeare's works numerically, using relative entropy as a quantitative indicator. For example, the relative low entropy between "Henry VI, Part 1" and the sequel show that this historical drama is coherent in style and structure, and the phenomenon of the grouping of works by genre suggests that Shakespeare followed a specific stylistic standard.<br><br>
        On the other hand, the GPT analysis qualitatively evaluates Shakespeare's style changes in terms of language, character complexity, subjective approach and structural innovation, which describes in detail his creative development. From the young experimental attempt to work first to the philosophical depth of the subsequent work, to the convergence of genres. Both analyses agree on the consistency of the first historical dramas and my entropy data support the quality assessment of GPT. In my data, the grouping of comedy and tragedy is consistent with the GPT's observation of increasing the complexity and depth of the subject, during maturity.<br><br>
        In conclusion, my unessay provide a rigorous data-based approach to understand the evolution of Shakespeare's style, while the qualitative analysis of GPT explores its artistic growth in an ethical way. The combination of both analyses shows a comprehensive and persuasive picture of how Shakespeare's style has changed and evolved over time.
