    <h1>HSS207 unessay Project</h1>
    
    <p>I am currently working on a digital history unessay project titled "Verifying the Authorship of William Shakespeare's Plays by Stylometry.(working title)"<br>
        This project involves natural language processing and word-adjacency network method to extract some meaningfull data from complete text data of William Shakespeare's plays.<br>
        The aim of the project is to compare and contrast similarity, differences of William Shakespeare's plays.</p>

    <h2>Main Question</h2>
    <p>The main question of the project is: Was William Shakespeare able to write all 37 plays alone?</p>

    <h2>Main Messages</h2>
    <p>The main messages of the project are:<br>
        Authorship of William Shakespeare is an active area of research.<br>
        Previous studies did not make sufficient research on Shakespeare's plays, such as just analyzing the contributions of Shakespeare and other writers.<br>
        So, I wanted to find out how similar Shakespeare's plays were in writing style.</p>
    
    <h2>Visualization</h2>
    <p>Below is a heatmap of relative entropies between William Shakespeare's plays:</p>
